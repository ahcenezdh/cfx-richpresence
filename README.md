Simple RichPresence, based on the code of someone (whom I don't remember, sorry) to update the count of players with a global state bag in the rich presence.

The configuration file is located in `shared/shared.lua`.

Compatible with ESX, QbCore, and standalone (for the standalone version, you need spawnmanager).
